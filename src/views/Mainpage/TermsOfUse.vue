              You can input data into EduNinja's Services ("Input") and receive generated outputs based on that Input ("Output"). 
              Together, they form the "Content". You retain ownership of all Input. In line with these Terms and relevant laws,

              Given the dynamics of machine learning, Outputs may not be distinctive across users. EduNinja might generate

              AI and machine learning are transformative fields. EduNinja strives to enhance its Services for precision, 
              reliability, and efficacy. Given machine learning's uncertain nature, there could be occasions where the 
              Service might deliver incorrect Outputs. For any critical application, it's prudent to assess the Output's 
              accuracy, including human verification if needed.
